				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<h3>Our Story</h3>
				<p>Established in 2023, MeowgAw began as a shared dream among a group of passionate students who believed that every pet deserves a loving home. 
                	Witnessing the challenges faced by numerous pets in need and recognizing the compassionate individuals within our campus community, 
                	our website emerged to bridge this gap.

					In the heart of our university, we were deeply moved by the plight of these animals, often abandoned and struggling to survive.
					
					Today, our pet adoption website stands as a testament to what can be achieved when people come together with a common purpose. 
					Stray dogs and cats now have a better chance at a brighter future, and the lives of countless families have been enriched by their four-legged companions.
